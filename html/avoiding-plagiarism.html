<h3 class="dcf-regular">Strategies to Discourage Plagiarism</h3>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong>&nbsp;Many effective strategies for teaching writing are also effective deterrents to
    student plagiarism.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Discuss intellectual property and academic integrity with writers (some writing handbooks have chapters on these
        topics). Help them understand the intellectual/writing issues involved, not just “what not to do.”</li>
    <li>Help writers understand how to use sources in their writing: practice summary, paraphrase, quotation.</li>
    <li>Design specific, unique assignments (not the old research or position papers). (The Writing Center can help!)
    </li>
    <li>Invite conversation and questions about the assignment; acknowledge difficulty and potential struggle.</li>
    <li>Negotiate specific projects, informed by writers’ goals, within general guidelines.</li>
    <li>Ask writers to collect specific artifacts or conduct their own observational research in addition to secondary
        research.</li>
    <li>Have writers join local conversations (UNL, Lincoln, their home communities).</li>
    <li>Encourage writers to use their own experiences and perspectives as sources of information and evidence in their
        projects.</li>
    <li>Incorporate regular in-class writing.</li>
    <li>Read multiple drafts throughout writers’ writing process (but don’t feel the need to respond to or grade
        everything; Blackboard could be helpful).</li>
    <li>Ask for author’s notes in which writers explain their choices.</li>
    <li>Incorporate frequent peer responses groups.</li>
    <li>Have writers compose revision plans.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="dcf-regular"><a name="SafeAssignment"></a>English Department Guidelines Regarding the Use of SafeAssignment
    (Adopted Spring 2007)</h3>
<p>SafeAssignment raises a number of pedagogical and ethical issues for student writers and teachers who solicit that
    writing. As teachers committed to creating educational environments that treat students with respect, we are
    concerned that requiring all students to use SafeAssignment can contribute to a “culture of suspicion” in which
    students’ integrity is assumed to be suspect. Also, certain uses of this software violate the English Department’s
    commitment to student ownership over their intellectual work. We believe that forcing students to use SafeAssignment
    or doing so without their permission violates this commitment because student work is held by a third party and
    students are offered limited recourse for refusing to participate or for removing their already stored work. As
    well, we are concerned about issues of forced disclosure, given the sometimes personal nature of the writing our
    students do in our classes. Finally, we believe that our primary goal concerning plagiarism should be to teach
    students about intellectual property and integrity, including the ethical use and citation of sources. The adoption
    of SafeAssignment, or any other plagiarism detection software, is not sufficient for these tasks.</p>
<p>In light of these concerns, we offer the following guidelines for teachers in the English Department who choose to
    use SafeAssignment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Students must be informed that their work will be subject to scrutiny through SafeAssignment.</li>
    <li>Students must be informed of the distinction between the “Draft Review” portion of the program, which does not
        retain their writing in the database, and the regular submission process, which does.</li>
    <li>Students must be allowed access to any results generated from SafeAssignment regarding their submitted writing.
    </li>
    <li>Students may object without penalty at any time to having their writing retained in the SafeAssignment database.
    </li>
    <li>Students must be made aware of the implications of this software: 1) that student writing is kept for six years
        following submission, 2) that according to University policy, students may refuse to submit a paper to
        SafeAssignment through the UNL Grade Appeals process, and 3) that a request to have writing removed from the
        SafeAssignment database earlier than the six year mark can also be processed through UNL Grade Appeals, but is
        by no means guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Students must be made aware that their work can potentially be retained by a third party (the SafeAssignment
        database) and potentially used for in-house reporting of educational statistics.</li>
    <li>Any disciplinary action that is sought based on a report generated from SafeAssignment must be accompanied by a
        detailed account by the instructor of the specific textual instances where plagiarism is alleged to have taken
        place to verify that plagiarism has actually occurred</li>
</ul>
