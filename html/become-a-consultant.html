        <h2>English 380: Writing Center Theory and Practice</h2>
        <p class="dcf-subhead">Course Description
        <p>This course explores theoretical and practical questions around teaching and learning in the writing center,
            primarily within a one-to-one context. We will investigate the growing field of Writing Center Studies and
            examine theories and pedagogical commitments that inform and shape the practice of writing center
            consulting. This course also involves a substantial research component, inviting you to explore some aspect
            of writing culture within or beyond UNL and produce original scholarship. You will have the opportunity to
            observe consultations in the Writing Center, reflect on your own and othersâ€™ writing processes and
            experiences, explore the theoretical foundations of writing center work, and consider how this work relates
            to social justice. Completing this course makes you eligible for (but does not guarantee) a position as a
            consultant in the Writing Center.</p>
