<h2 class="dcf-txt-h4 dcf-regular">Why integrate writing into a course?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Students deepen their knowledge of course material by writing. Whether reflecting on what they’ve learned,
        composing a question, or connecting knowledge to lived experience, writing extends students’ engagement of a
        subject.</li>
    <li>If students have had a chance to explore the course material through writing, they are likely to feel more
        invested in it, to be better able to discuss it, and to retain what they’ve learned.</li>
    <li>Reading our students’ writing—whether a paragraph describing a lecture or a research paper—gives us a heightened
        sense of their grasp on the course concepts. This, in turn, allows us to teach to their needs.</li>
    <li>Writing gives students practice in participating in the discipline. Rather than simply testing their acquisition
        of knowledge, writing provides an opportunity to analyze, challenge and contribute to existing ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="dcf-txt-h4 dcf-regular">Why are my students poor writers?</h2>
<p>We’ve found that instructors often conflate “poor writing” with issues of usage and grammar. While it may seem that
    complaints of student error are unique to our times—a product of text-messaging and media-saturation—the complaint
    is nothing new, nor is the percentage of errors on the rise. Robert Connors and Andrea Lunsford conducted a study
    comparing types and frequency of error of contemporary students with studies done from 1917-1930. They found that,
    in fact, the rate of error (about two per hundred words) remained consistent over time. What has changed, though, is
    what constitutes an error, which depends on current standards of language.</p>
<p>Our students will be better served if we are transparent about what constitutes good writing in our discipline and if
    we are clear about how to define error. John Bean offers some observations about error that may also help us to
    understand it more complexly:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Even in an error-laden essay, an actual count of the errors reveals that there are many more correct sentences
        than flawed ones.” Bean reminds us that our “psychology of reading” shapes our location of error in student
        papers. Individual teachers tend to notice different errors. If we are looking for particular errors, they are
        highly visible to us.</li>
    <li>“What constitutes ‘error’ really involves stylistic choices—issues of rhetorical effectiveness and grace rather
        than right-or-wrong adherence to rules.” If we find wordiness or passive voice abounding in our papers, rather
        than approaching these as errors, we might devote time to instructing students on why these are not appropriate
        in a given rhetorical context (the lab report, the book review).</li>
    <li>“Errors in student writing increase with greater cognitive difficulty.” As students enter new academic
        territory, other skills may temporarily regress. By building in multiple drafts, students will have the chance
        to correct these errors and further their thinking.</li>
    <li>“Teachers can expect to see sentence problems in first drafts and on essay exams.” Students tend to produce less
        error-ridden prose when they have opportunities to draft, receive feedback, and revise. In the case of the essay
        exam, not only are students writing under pressure, but they are engaging in a cognitively challenging task.
        (See also “How do I improve writing on essay exams?”)</li>
    <li>“Traditional procedures for grading and marking student papers may exacerbate the problem.” Well-intentioned
        teachers often tell us that to improve students’ grammar, they mark every error they find. Not only is this
        time-consuming (and frustrating) for the instructor, it can be counterproductive. Instead, try marking one or
        two patterns of error you see, and provide an explanation of why a rule has been violated. Then, let the student
        correct his/her own text—she will learn far more by doing so.</li>
    <li>“Student errors are systematic and classifiable.” That is to say, there is a difference between errors that
        occur in a pattern in a student’s paper—which demonstrates confusion about a rule—and a “mistake” made out of
        haste or lack of proofreading. If you find an error made consistently throughout a piece of writing, call
        attention to it and help the student understand why it isn’t correct. If the issue is a mistake, you might
        emphasize the need for editing, providing students strategies of how to do so.</li>

<h2 class="dcf-regular dcf-txt-h4">How do I encourage my students to revise?</h2>
<p>Many of us, our students included, carry around the idea that good writers, real writers, get it right the first
    time. As instructors, we need to help students understand (and remind ourselves, too) that good writers spend much
    more time revising than they do drafting.</p>
<div class="dcf-w-max-md dcf-ml-auto dcf-mr-auto">
    <blockquote class="dcf-blockquote">
        <p>Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere. Start by getting
            something—anything—down on paper. A friend of mine says that the first draft is the down draft—you just get
            it down. The second draft is the up draft—you fix it up. You try to say what you have to say more
            accurately. And the third draft is the dental draft, where you check every tooth to see if it’s loose or
            cramped or decayed, or even, God help us, healthy.</p>
        <footer class="dcf-attribution">Anne Lamott, <cite>Bird by Bird (p26)</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
</div>
<p>If we want students to move from the down draft to the dental draft, though, we need to support the writing process.
    Here are some ways you can do this:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Create writing assignments that leave room for students to explore an issue or problem of genuine
            interest</i>. If the writing is driven by inquiry—rather than providing a pre-determined answer—they will be
        more apt to revise.</li>
    <li><i>Make clear to your students that revision is different from editing</i>. Help them understand that revision
        involves not only tweaking the text, but also re-examining the ideas within the text. You might provide them
        examples of a text at different stages of the revision process.</li>
    <li><i>Build time into your course to accommodate the writing process</i>. You might set one deadline for first
        drafts, and then leave time in class for students to share texts and offer feedback to one another in small
        groups. If you can’t spare the class time, encourage them to visit the Writing Center (Love Library N203), where
        they can talk through their process with a consultant. Leave adequate time between assigning the paper and its
        deadline for genuine revision to take place.</li>
    <li><i>Give your students’ papers the majority of your comments while they are in process, not when the final
            version has been turned in</i>. That said, try not make your comments so extensive that the student feels
        overwhelmed. Focus your response on one or two central goals for revision, so that the student has an achievable
        goal.</li>
    <li><i>Don’t forget to point out what is working in the draft</i>. This gives the student language for what she is
        doing well, so that she can repeat it.</li>
    <li><i>Require students to submit all drafts along with their final copy</i>. This will give you (and the student) a
        sense of how your students have progressed to the final version of the assignment.</li>
    <li><i>Consider asking students to write a “process account,” in which they document the rationale that shaped the
            changes made in their revision process</i>. If you choose to include attention to process in their final
        grade, a process account will help you evaluate this component.</li>
    <li><i>Model revision</i>. Consider letting students see a piece that you have revised for publication, from an
        early articulation to a mid-process draft to final version. This will give them evidence that professional
        writers do, indeed, revise.</li>

<h2 class="dcf-regular dcf-txt-h4">How can I promote improved writing on essay exams?</h2>
<p>Essay exams can offer many potential benefits to students: they give students an opportunity to synthesize material,
    to learn to think and compose quickly, and to use course material to make arguments. Here are some strategies that
    will help the learning potential of essay exams.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Teach your students how to write essay exams</i>. Often we tell students we value “clear” writing or that
        they must provide “coherent” responses. Since no student sets out to write in an unclear or incoherent manner,
        this advice is usually ineffective. Instead, provide students examples of exams that are exceptional, average,
        and poor. Help them to understand why each received the grade it did.</li>
    <li><i>Be clear about whether your grading will include usage, grammar, etc</i>. If so, be sure to give students
        adequate time to look over their answers and make revisions.</li>
    <li><i>Allow students to practice, either writing in class or taking a practice exam as homework</i>. This gives the
        student another opportunity to see what you value in an answer in why. In addition, it gives students another
        opportunity to learn by writing.</li>
    <li><i>Call for thesis-governed writing</i>. This will increase the chances that students write a succinct, clear
        essay. If the question uses verbs such as “discuss,” “analyze,” “compare and contrast,” students tend to stray
        from the task. If you use imperatives, make sure the task is well contextualized. For instance, “What are the
        pros and cons of using pesticides to control mosquitoes?” is clearer than “Discuss the use of pesticides in
        controlling mosquitoes” (Bean 192).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="dcf-regular dcf-txt-h4">How do I incorporate writing into a large lecture course?</h2>
<p>While it may be impossible to require a course of 100 students to write research papers, incorporating writing into
    your lecture course is still possible. Below are ideas that allow students to write-to-learn that are also
    manageable for the instructor.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Develop guided journals to accompany your lectures</i>. You might ask students to write short responses (a
        couple of paragraphs will do) to link lecture information to their own experiences, to apply it other contexts,
        or to critique or question the ideas presented.</li>
    <li><i>Incorporate writing moments into the lecture</i>. You might stop your lecture and ask students to write for
        several moments about how the presented material interests, challenges, or confuses them. Invite a couple of
        students to share their responses. This will facilitate both learning through writing and dialogue between you
        and the students.</li>
    <li><i>Invite student questions in writing</i>. At the end of your lecture, you might invite students to compose a
        question about or response to the material. This will give you a sense of how students are interacting with the
        knowledge presented.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="dcf-regular">What’s the difference between high-stakes and low-stakes writing? Why does it matter?</h3>
<p>High-stakes writing bears the pressure of a grade, of passing or failing a class, of being allowed or denied entrance
    into a program. Most of the writing composed in the college classroom is high-stakes, because students know it will
    be evaluated.</p>
<p>While high-stakes writing is certainly important, students also need opportunities for low-stakes or exploratory
    writing. Exploratory writing allows students to think on paper, to raise questions, to present uncertainties, or to
    grapple with course materials without the pressure of a grade. For this reason, it serves as an important precursor
    to higher-stakes writing, because it enables students to discover ideas, to try out several directions, and
    eventually, to discover a clearer focus.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as John Bean notes, “college students do not
    [typically] realize the value of exploratory writing and are not given nearly enough opportunities for doing it”
