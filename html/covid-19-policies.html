<p>We are excited to meet with folks in person as well as online this semester, but it will look a little different than in past semesters:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to keep our staff and the broader UNL community as safe as we can, <strong>we respectfully request that you wear a mask at all times in the Writing Center</strong>. Disposable masks are available in the Writing Center for your use.</li>
<li>To protect both writers and consultants, we will be social distancing during sessions. The Center will have sets of 2 round tables pushed together; you will sit at one, and the consultant will sit at the other.</li>
<li>So both you and your consultant can see your writing while sitting apart from each other, <strong>please upload your draft in advance on WCOnline</strong>. This will enable you and your consultant to view it on separate devices. <strong>OR, you can plan to arrive a few minutes early so you can print out two paper copies in the Writing Center</strong> (printing is free if it’s for use during a consultation).</li>
<li>If you have questions, please feel encouraged to contact the Writing Center between 9 am and 4:30 pm at 402-472-8803 whenever classes are in session.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this sounds like a lot, don’t worry: we are available online during all of our open hours! You can always choose an Online (real time, video chat) appointment, or you can upload your draft for an eTutoring (email feedback) appointment. (Please note: eTutoring appointments are limited in number and only available from 4:30-9 pm.)</p>
