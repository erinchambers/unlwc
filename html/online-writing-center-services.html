    <h2 class="dcf-txt-h4">In addition to in-person consultations, we have TWO ways you can work with us online:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Online consultations:</strong> these are <strong>real-time, video consultations</strong> with a
            Writing Center consultant. You will log in to our scheduling system, <a
                href="https://unl.mywconline.com/">https://unl.mywconline.com</a>, a few minutes before your scheduled
            appointment time and meet online with the consultant. All appointments this year are 40 minutes in length.
        </li>
        <li><strong>eTutoring appointments:</strong> eTutoring appointments allow you to receive email feedback from a
            consultant. When you make an appointment, you will attach a piece of writing<strong> (5 pages
                maximum)</strong>, and a Writing Center consultant will provide written feedback, which you will receive
            shortly after the appointment time you signed up for.</li>
    </ul>
