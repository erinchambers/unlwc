    <h5>Official Mission Statement:</h5>
    <p>The mission of the UNL Writing Center is to provide one-with-one tutoring in writing to all members of the UNL
        community. We work with writers at all stages of development and at every stage of the writing process. The
        Writing Center is dedicated to promoting and supporting research in writing and writing pedagogy. We provide a
        site for ongoing research as well as encouraging engagement in writing research among our undergraduate and
        graduate staff. The Writing Center acknowledges the integral relationships between literacy education and the
        democratization of higher education. We are committed both to our role in increasing access to that education
        for all students and to the development, practice, and evolution of anti-oppression pedagogies. We are committed
        to cultivating a broad-based recognition of the value of World Englishes to both intellectual and public
        discourse. We ally with and advocate for writers from historically marginalized or oppressed groups and for
        writing that counters traditional accounts of “standard” academic English by extending conceptions of audience,
        purpose, and meaning. <em>(revised May 2011)</em></p>

        <p>The UNL Writing Center also contributes to the English department’s mission of fostering imaginative
            reasoning, with its emphases on social justice, diversity, community and civic engagement, and
            belonging--values that are at the heart of the work we do. We ask writers to imagine, within given
            rhetorical contexts, different possibilities for their writing, and, likewise, to reason through which
            possibilities will bring the most desired outcomes. By advocating for the mindful use of rhetorical
            strategies in context and the transfer of writing knowledge across genres, the Writing Center underscores
            writers’ empowered roles in shaping meaning within broader societal and academic contexts.</p>
