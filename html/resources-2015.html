        journal articles, autobiographies and learning logs to enhance students’ ability
        to understand mathematical concepts. Countryman provides examples of student

    <div class="summary">
      <p>In this series of short case-studies, Chris Anson allows instructors to play the
        "what-if" game with a number of issues pertaining to WAC/WID. Readable and
        challenging, Anson asks us to think about complex issues such as designing
        writing assignments across courses, negotiating competing goals in an
        inter-disciplinary course setting and responding effectively to student writing.
        At the heart of this book, Anson asks teachers interested in WAC to consider
        what´s important about student writing and how it can best be used to enhance a
        student´s academic experience.</p>
      <p>For example, in the case titled "Showdown at Midwestern U.," a lively email
        exchange occurs between two professors with competing ideologies about the
        purpose of general education writing courses. Bob, a department chair of the
        economics department, comes to Sherry, the director of the Office of Campus
        Writing, arguing the purpose a first-year writing class should be to teach
        students how to construct arguments based on a synthesis of other literary
        texts. Sherry counters by arguing that since so much writing done in an academic
        setting is discipline-specific, developing a student´s ability to write about
        literature would serve only to make them more adept at writing about
        literature.</p>
      <p>At the end of this and other case-studies in the book, Anson provides a set of
        open-ended questions for readers to consider. These grand questions about
        writing´s different purposes across disciplines are what make this book a fine
        entry-point for those interested in familiarizing themselves with the ongoing
        conversations at work in WAC/WID.</p>

        initiatives. The second part of the book outlines 3 major approaches to theory
        and research in WAC: classroom writing practices, writing to learn, and rhetoric
        of inquiry. In higher education, students often do not see the personal or
        professional relevance of the goals of writing in disciplinary courses. Across
        studies students seem to share the "struggle to come to discover what it is they
        know, what it is they are committed to, and how those perceptions and
        commitments can be enacted in professional and academic ways" (47) suggesting
        that writing in any discipline needs to be made relevant to students" lives. The
        book suggests new directions for the WAC movement including writing intensive
        courses, Writing Center and peer tutor initiatives, interdisciplinary learning
        communities, service learning, and electronic communication across the

      <p>The article is intended for faculty and administrators involved in the early

        suggests Writing Across the Curriculum programs can and should serve as sites of

        discipline−specific writing practices, students should also be made conscious of
        the social construction and history of disciplinary norms, thus making critical
        thinking skills central to the teaching of writing. Cohen argues faculty and
        administrators must work together from within existing disciplinary structures

        more general issues of teaching and learning that go beyond disciplines (45).
        Britton´s piece investigates how students use structures and tools they have
        developed in other experiences to make sense of new concepts and ideas.
        Bazerman, in "From Cultural Criticism to Disciplinary Participation: Living with
        Powerful Words" argues that we must make visible the historical, shifting,
        multivoiced make up of the disciplines so students see the social consequences
        of their work in these disciplines. Judith Langer explores the difference
        between making content or the rules of discourse the subject matter of our
        courses as opposed to making ways of inquiring and thinking central to the work
        of teaching and learning. In response to the call for teachers to develop more
        accurate language for talking about discipline-specific thinking and writing
        with students, Odell looks at patterns of thinking that influence how
        disciplinary instructors evaluate good writing. The final section examines the

      <p>Herrington and Curtis follow four college students over a period of their years

        objects" psychoanalytic theory of personal development, they demonstrate that
        writing in all contexts is a more than merely an act of self expression and is
        rather a self-constituting act, one that is always carried out in relationship
        with others such as ones audience. Herrington and Curtis contend that because
        students" writing development is closely tied to identity development, teachers
        across the disciplines must learn to be empathetic, respectful and understanding
        listeners, responders and analysts as much of the personal contact students have
        with teacher is through writing. Furthermore, they argue students continue to
        develop as writers throughout their academic careers when writing is infused

        finally to include those voices in our campus development efforts if we hope to
        successfully increase active student engagement across the campus. Light
        interviews college students asking them a variety of questions about learning
        experiences in all areas of campus life. Specifically concerning writing, Light
        notes that student respondents reported wanting more discipline-specific writing
        instruction in their upper division courses and students reported that writing
        instruction was most effective when writing was incorporated throughout the
        semester in their courses. Additionally, Light notes that academic development
        and personal development are tied"as students learn and process their coursework
        they learn and change as individuals and subjects. Students find meaningful
        learning experiences when their academic coursework extends and connects with
        their lives outside of school.</p>

      <p>A review of David Russell´s book contends a discipline grows up when someone

        traditionally been conceptualized in academic settings and argues Writing Across
        the Curriculum is not merely a passing fad or a new way of talking about an
        already failed experiment. Instead, Russell demonstrates how WAC work has been a
        cornerstone of American intellectual life since Harvard´s founding in the 17th
        Century.</p>
      <p>While other histories of composition in the United States make for a more
        engaging read (think James Berlin´s Rhetoric for example), the conclusions
        pertinent to WAC/WID interests he comes to at the end of the book make it

      <p>This practical book outlines core principles guiding WAC work, provides a case
        study of what one university´s WAC program looks like and gives a number of

        disciplines are represented in the book and each articulates how the WAC
        principles outlined in the introduction are implemented in a specific kind of
        class. For example, a professor in computer science shows how he teaches the
        basic structure of computer programming by showing how similar writing code can

    <div class="summary">
      <p>Thaiss and Zawacki conduct a study at George Mason in which they interview
        professors from a variety of disciplines about how they write, how they teach
        writing and how they think about "alternative discourses," defined either as
        resistance against disciplinary norms or as alternate but acceptable forms. They
        interview students from across disciplines as well and find that students go
        through three stages as writers: 1) They believe they know what all teachers
        want because they have a sense of the "generic" standards most disciplines
        share; 2) They recognize differences in expectations as idiosyncratic; 3) They
        recognize differences as discipline and context specific. Students might not
        reach the final stage because "they do not become sufficiently invested in the
        discipline´s academic discourses, developing instead a greater connection to
        nonacademic audiences and exigencies" (110). The final chapter about pedagogical
        implications recommends ways to facilitate students" development into the third
        stage, and includes suggestions for faculty across the disciplines, composition
        program administrators and faculty development programs. The authors propose

      <p>Zerbe argues that scientific discourse is the major discourse of our time.
        Compositionists cannot claim to help our students develop the skills and
        mentalities needed for meaningful civic participation, a goal often strived for
        by rhetoric and composition programs, if we do not teach them to understand and
        engage the complexity of scientific discourse. Not only should students and
        teachers in composition classrooms work toward a more sophisticated "scientific
        literacy," but instructors in scientific disciplines need to help students
        become conscious of the rhetorical, historical, economic, social, ethical and
        personal aspects of the discourse in which they are learning to communicate.
