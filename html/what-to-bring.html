<p>When you come to the writing center for a consultation you should bring a written copy of your assignment if you have
    one. If you are writing an assignment for a class, bring your syllabus. Bring any writing you have done for your
    assignment or project (your most recent draft and, if it seems useful to you, bring prior drafts). If you are
    working on an application essay for graduate school, bring the prompt to which you've been asked to respond. If you
    are coming to the writing center to work on a longer project such as a thesis or dissertation, you may want to set
    up regular appointment with a single consultant. Certainly, for your first few appointments, bring any written
    description of departmental or programmatic expectations for theses or dissertations in your discipline.</p>
