<p><em>Do you have a stapler I can use? </em>Yes, we do! Come on in.</p>
<p><em>Do I need to make an appointment or can I walk in?&nbsp; </em><br /> We prefer writers to make appointments so
    that there will definitely be a consultant available, but we do work with writers who drop by whenever we can. Do
    know that we get real busy around midterms and finals each semester. Do plan for these times and call ahead if you
    possibly can.</p>
<p><em>Can I set an appointment for the same day/time each week? </em><br /> You bet! One thing we know for sure is that
    becoming a better writer takes time.<br /> We are excited to work with writers who are willing to become regulars in
    the Writing Center.</p>
<p><em>Can I print my paper here?</em> <br /> If you are printing a paper you will be using during a consultation,
    yes.&nbsp; If not, there are computer labs available for printing purposes in the basement of Andrews, in Love
    Library, and in other locations around campus.</p>
<p><em>Can I drop my paper off for copy-editing and pick it up later?</em><br /> Well, urrrr. No. We are all about
    learning in the Writing Center. If you drop your paper off and one of us edits it for you, we are pretty sure you
    will miss out on the learning. Additionally, we find when working with writers that often times grammar issues are
    most pronounced when folks are struggling with what they want to say and how best to say it. Those kinds of writerly
    questions make for very productive conversations, but are not so good for an outside editor to address without
    working closely with the writer.</p>
<p><em>Can I come to the Writing Center everyday or have appointments that last two or three hours instead of 25 or 50
        minutes?</em><br /> We are going to do our best to accommodate your needs. And we know that learning writers
    need time to work on their own as well as time to talk with other writers. So, we are going to encourage you to work
    with us a bit and then work on your own a bit. You might consider spending some additional time in the Writing
    Center after your consultation working on your draft. If a consultant is free and you need to ask a quick question
    or want some feedback on a passage or two, you can always ask. Just know that there are only a few of us and a whole
    lot of writers here at UNL. We need to be sure we give as many writers access to our services as we can in order to
    be fair.</p>
<p><em>What if the Writing Center consultant I am working with does not seem to understand my work or me?</em><br />
    Hmmm. Well, this does not happen very often, but when it does what we do not want you to do is walk away mad. Come
    talk to our Director or our Assistant Director. One of them will listen to you and work with you to find a
    consultant who will be able to work well with you. They will keep listening and talking with you until they have
    found the right consultant for you.</p>
