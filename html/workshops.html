<p>Writing Center staff are available for both brief classroom presentations about the Writing Center as well as longer,
    collaborative co-teach sessions on a variety of subjects. To request a <strong>10-15 minute class visit</strong> to
    discuss what we do at the Writing Center, please <strong><a
            href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s981ub7dzKh2FgQ03JfCcrBNLmfGf8CfHzk8jruGhg8/viewform">fill out this
            form</a></strong>. Class visits may take place in person or via Zoom.&nbsp;Note: since we are primarily
    staffed by students, we generally cannot visit classes during the first week of the semester. Moreover, it is often
    more helpful for us to visit when you are assigning the first piece of writing in the class, since students will be
    more receptive to the information when they can put it to immediate use.</p>
<p>If you would like to collaborate on a session that goes into greater depth or is tailored to your specific class,
    please contact the Writing Center at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:writingcenter@unl.edu">writingcenter@unl.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Before contacting us about a tailored session please note the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We ask that you contact us at least 2-3 weeks in advance, to give us time to prepare and to collaborate with
        you.</li>
    <li>Please note that we call these tailored sessions "co-teach" sessions: that is, we will develop a plan together
        with you and deliver it together to the class. Thus, we will not visit on days when the instructor of record is
        not present. It is important for the course instructor to be able to give context to the material we discuss
        during a co-teach session. Furthermore, presenting the writing-related material collaboratively helps students
        understand that writing is, in fact, integral to your course.</li>
