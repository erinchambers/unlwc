    <p>Writing Fellows are primarily undergraduate Writing Center consultants who support faculty and students in particular classes across the disciplines. Fellows work closely with and are mentored by the faculty members teaching the course. Writing Fellows talk through ideas and problems with students to help them figure out how to express their own ideas as clearly and effectively as possible. Writing Fellows are not editors or proofreaders; rather, they are peers who work to help students meet their writing goals in these courses and become stronger, more confident writers and thinkers. </p>
    <p>The Writing Fellows program supports courses at a variety of levels and from a wide range of disciplines. Our past collaborations have included courses in History, Political Science, Civil Engineering, Biology, Women’s and Gender Studies, and Agricultural Leadership, Education, and Communication, including several sections dedicated to William H. Thompson Scholars.</p>

      <h2 id="why" class="dcf-regular">Why Participate?</h2>
      <p><strong>Create more opportunities for feedback on student writing:</strong> Writing Fellows make it possible for faculty teaching courses outside of English to assign more and/or different writing assignments and to implement or enhance a drafting and revision process for student writing in that course. </p>
      <p><strong>Identify student challenges around writing:</strong> Fellows also serve as a direct conduit between faculty and students. They help translate faculty goals to students, while also identifying trends and challenges that students are experiencing around writing, which they can communicate back to faculty.</p>
      <p><strong>Improve student confidence and transferable writing skills:</strong> students have reported that working with a Writing Fellow improved their experience in the course, helped them be successful in the course, and helped them grow as writers by developing transferable writing skills.</p>
